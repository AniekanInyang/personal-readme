## How to work with Kaeti Hinck

### My work hours:
I usually start my days with an hour or two of work at home: answering emails, editing projects, writing project docs, HR tasks, etc. You can reach me by Slack during these times, but I try to avoid meetings in the early ayem.

My working hours are usually 8 to 6ish, but an editor's life means that I am available if you need something outside of those hours. I'm available by Slack pretty much 24/7 (but I do NOT expect the same from my team). Please call for middle-of-the-night breaking news.

When I'm on vacation, I try to be as offline as possible. Often this means going to a literal wilderness with no cell reception.

### What’s the best way to communicate with me?

I prefer Slack to email, but if I don't respond, email is a great follow up (Slacks can get lost in the fray). 

If you want to talk about project ideas, or career/life stuff, in person is my default. For most things, I prefer a quick in-person chat — less opportunity for misunderstanding, builds relationships, and it's often faster.

*If I don’t respond, try:* Follow up email, or ping me again on Slack. Don't feel bad about bugging me (you're not). For breaking news/emergencies, reach me by text or phone call.

### I'd love to help you with ____
Honing your story ideas, working with you on page/interface design, talking through career questions+goals. 

I have a hodgepodge of design and visual journalism experience, so I can help with photo + video editing, making GIFs, design prototyping, creating iconography, drawing, color theory, pattern libraries + style guides, and UX/UI best practices.

In a past life I was also a magazine editor. If you need help sharpening your prose, I'm happy to give things a read.

### What makes me grumpy?
I don't like revisiting decisions that have already been made (unless there's a good reason, naturally). I also have a strong aversion to unstructured meetings. Protips: send out an agenda, make sure everyone has an opportunity to be heard, and establish clear action items before folks leave the room.

It's pretty easy to look at other peoples' calendars when you schedule meetings. I wish more people took advantage of that Outlook feature. 
	
### How do I like to give feedback?
I like giving big picture feedback in person (on projects, career development, etc.). For the nitty gritty, I often give feedback via slack, and try to document to-dos in Trello so they don't get lost. 

I also prefer giving feedback in a 1:1 context (versus large meetings), so I may follow up with you after a bigger meeting.

I haaaaaaate email threads as a feedback mechanism. But I do love sending out congratulatory emails — bragging on y'all is the best part of my job.

### How do I like to receive feedback?
I prefer in person, but slack and email are totally great if that's the way you're most comfortable communicating. Sometimes it's easier to get things in writing and then have a follow up conversation. 

I am very open to hearing feedback **anytime**. If there's something I can do to make your work easier, or something I'm doing is causing you stress, PLEASE speak up. If you're not comfortable chatting with me directly, feel free to give Chiqui or Tim a head's up, and they can filter the info back to me.

### One of my goals for the coming year:
To build relationships with researchers at Harvard + MIT for my Nieman fellowship. I'd also like to get a new PR in my deadlift. 

### Topics I’m always happy to talk about:
Weight lifting, tarot, the food spectrum (is a hotdog a sandwich?), the books I'm reading, structural oppression, aerial arts, packing cubes, complicated skincare routines, Ursula K. Le Guin, assorted podcasts.

### Other things you might want to know:

* **My favorite baked good:** All of them. I love making cookies and pie. I also love a cherry danish from the Thursday white house farmer's market.
* **Spouses/partners/kiddos/pets:** Partner, Raph, and our pet turtle, Soup
* **Fruit on pizza?** Pineapple and Jalapeño
* **My coffee order:** Cortado (with oat milk), or iced latte, or various teas. My top drawer is always stocked with tea — help yourself
* **My hometown:** Minneapolis (THE BEST CITY IN THE WORLD)
* **Sports loyalties:** MN Twins and the Lynx
* **My favorite GIF:**
