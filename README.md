# Personal READMEs
Our team at Post Graphics added a bunch of new people â€” and with each new hire, a unique set of talents, personality quirks, and work habits. In order to help our team learn how to work with each other, we decided to document our preferences in an easy-to-access place (a private github repo that everyone on the team has access to). 

We set aside an hour one day to sit in a room together, eat snacks, and work on our personal READMEs. The result: We got to know our colleagues and ourselves better, and had a lot of fun picking out our favorite gifs and pizza toppings.
